# Runtime Configuration

Technolinator is available as container image: `ghcr.io/mediamarktsaturn/technolinator:VERSION` ![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MediaMarktSaturn/technolinator?label=latest%20version&sort=semver&style=flat-square)
There is in addition a container image tagged with `fat-VERSION` containing even or SDKs (like Swift).

You can run it by providing the minimal configuration values as listed below. Please have a look to the [adoption doc](./Adoption.md) as well to fine tune the image to your needs.

Technolinator is configured via the following parameter which can either be provided via ENV, or be put in a `.env` file in the apps working directory.

## Observability

Technolinator's process can best be followed using its log. Every push event received is noted, and the output of cdxgen is logged as well.
In addition, Technolinator provides Prometheus metrics about push events and analysis results.

There's a Grafana dashboard available in [here](/_dashboards), that visualizes these metrics.
